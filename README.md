# DELTA-GREEN-STATS
A simple tool to create Delt Green player stat through point-buy or random dice rolls.

This project is based on creating a simple single HTML file that can easily be shared and edited to fit your or your group's athletics.

The page facilitates three character creation options, Point Buy, Random Point Buy and Random Dice Roll options for quick and easy Agent or NPC builds for the Delta Green Role Play System:

'RANDOM POINT BUY' Will randomly allocate all 72-point buy points between your Stats.
'RANDOM DICE ROLL' Will roll 4xD6 and ignore the lowest number dividing the remaining points randomly between your stats. 
'RESET' Will set all Stats to 3 by default so you can manually add to your Stats with the 72-point buy points.  

This project is made by a noob and held together with sticky tape and AI logic. 
In keeping with simplicity the project is contained in a single HTML file only using HTML, CCS, and Java.
